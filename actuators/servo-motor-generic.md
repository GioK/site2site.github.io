Here is a simple, low-cost, high quality servo for all your mechatronic needs. This servo is very similar in size and specifications to the Hitec HS-55. This little guy is able to take in 6 volts and deliver 20.8 oz-in. of maximum torque at 0.10 sec/60°

This small servo comes with a standard 3 pin power and control cable, and all hardware listed below.

Note: This servo is rated for 180° rotation, but in actuality it only hits ~160°.
