### Site to Site is a collaborative effort to build a platform for architecture in a world of connected objects. Focused around a course taught at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) at Columbia University, Site to Site is a collaborative effort that brings architects, urban planners and designers, preservationists, real estate developers, curators and historians together with other designers and technologists through an open source [Github organization](https://github.com/site2site).
