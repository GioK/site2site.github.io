### Site to Site is a collaborative effort to build an open source platform for architecture in a world of connected objects.

### Focused around a course taught at the [Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation](http://www.arch.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, Site to Site is a collaborative effort between architects, urban planners and designers, preservationists, real estate developers, curators and historians of the built environment and other designers and technologists.
