##	PLATeFORM

PLATeFORM removes the middle-man to allow the physical surface on which architects work individually to actually become the environment in which work is produced and provides a digital and physical space for collaborative work.


## Scenario

![Current surfaces](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5523/9722011812_dc7cdb9f3d_b.jpg)

Contemporary architecture practice demands a  continuous fluency across digital and physical media and platforms.

What if we could remove the middle man and have all of this media exist in the same plane?

And what if that same surface allowed for realtime interaction across physical space?

PLATeFORM enables low tech hardware to completely remove any line between physical and virtual, individual and collective.
